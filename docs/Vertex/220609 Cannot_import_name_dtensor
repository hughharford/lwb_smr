Cannot import name 'dtensor' from 'tensorflow.compat.v2.experimental'

   VERTEX

This can be caused by an incompatibility between your tensorflow and your keras versions. In particular I see this with tensorflow==2.6.0 and keras==2.9.0, though I would not be surprised if other versions can cause this as well.

Either update your tensorflow version by:

pip install tensorflow==2.8

or downgrade your keras version by:

pip install keras==2.6


OUR ATTEMPT:
		THE BELOW DIDN'T WORK
in the reqs is:	keras==2.6
doesn't work yet
the above tensorflow==2.8 is a bit complex as we are tensorflow-gpu

Before you must delete tensorflow and keras folder at site-package. Open admin command prompt use this codes

pip uninstall tensorflow 

pip install tensorflow --ignore-installed
