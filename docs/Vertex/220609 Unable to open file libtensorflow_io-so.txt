THIS WORKED 22 06 08:

Obvious workaround is to uninstall tensorflow and tensorflow-io and install them from pip:
pip uninstall tensorflow
pip uninstall tensorflow-io
pip install tensorflow-gpu
pip install --no-deps tensorflow-io


ISSUE CAME BACK AROUND WHEN REINSTALLED tensorflow TO SOLVE ANOTHER ISSUE

ALSO, couldn't then import tf!

SOLUTION:
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

ran ok, but only after doing the following again:

pip uninstall tensorflow-gpu
pip install tensorflow-gpu

NOTE
pip install -e . 
		DOES NOT WORK
		this command seems to skip the requirements.txt issue of: --no-deps tensorflow-io
		Which would usually cause issues
		

PROVIDED WE RUN pip install -e . AND THEN THESE 2, LOCAL RUN WORKS:
pip uninstall tensorflow-gpu
pip install tensorflow-gpu
